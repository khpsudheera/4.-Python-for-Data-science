# 🚗 Car Features & Market Analysis using Python
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a car dataset to understand vehicle features, safety aspects, and capacity trends. Using Python and data analysis libraries, meaningful insights were derived to support business and product-level decision-making.
The analysis is divided into two structured parts:

## Part 1: Data understanding, cleaning, and descriptive analysis
## Part 2: Advanced insights, feature evaluation, and visual interpretation
## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze car feature distribution across models
- Evaluate safety features like Central Locking and Child Safety Locks
- Understand seating capacity trends
- Derive business-relevant insights using statistical measures
## 🧩 Dataset Description
The dataset contains structured information about different car models, including:
- Seating Capacity
- Safety Features (Central Locking, Child Safety Locks)
- Model-level attributes
## 📂 Data Source: Excel file (C4_Project_data.xlsx)
## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy – Numerical operations
- Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib – Data visualization
- Seaborn – Statistical visualizations
## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Missing value and feature presence analysis
- Percentage and frequency distribution of safety features
- Average seating capacity calculation
- Insight interpretation for business use cases
## 📊 Key Insights
- Average seating capacity across models is approximately 5+ seats, indicating a strong focus on family-oriented vehicles
- Over 85% of car models include Central Locking, highlighting safety prioritization
## 💼 Business Relevance
- This project demonstrates how data analysis can support automotive market decisions, including:
- Feature prioritization
- Safety compliance evaluation
- Customer-focused product design
- It is well-suited for Business Analyst, Data Analyst, and Product Analytics roles.
- Child Safety Locks are present in more than 90% of vehicles, showing compliance with safety standards
